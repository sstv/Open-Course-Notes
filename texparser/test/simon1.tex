\section{This is Section 1}

In section 1, I want to discuss the power of $2^4$.

Then I want to discuss this:
$$ a^n = b^n + c^n $$.

What is it, how is it relevant?

\section{This is Section 2}
\subsection{Subsections are great}

Have you considered using subsections? They are pretty $g^{r^{e^{a^{t}}}}$
